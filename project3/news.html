        <span>Said The Sky is returning to Red Rocks with a brand new live show that covers his entire career. This
            summer, the melodic bass superstar will give fans the quintessential Said The Sky experience at one of the
            most iconic concert venues in the United States. Those who join him in his home town in the Colorado
            mountains will get the chance to hear many of his collaborative singles, album hits, remixes and more,
            including music from February's scintillating Sentiment LP. </span>
