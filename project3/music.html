                <h3>Information</h3>
                <span>Sentiment was released on February 18, 2022. Said the Sky's intentions with this
                    album were to give a nostalgic feel. With appearances from We The Kings, The Maine,
                    and more the features on this album resemble a 2010s Warped Tour flyer. This album
                    will leave you reminiscing, filled with warm feelings of nostalgia. It has a nice
                    cross between electronic and rock with pop punk and emo-inspired electronic
                    offerings. While it was an ambitious undertaking, Sentiment never feels forced.
                    Bringing listeners in with breezy acoustic guitars and augmenting the energy with
                    punchy drums, soaring riffs, and dense synth pads, Said The Sky creates a combination
                    that feels fresh throughout the record, and well worth returning to after it's concluded.

                    <h3>Information</h3>
                    <span>Wide-Eyed was released on July 20, 2018 and was Said the Sky's first album. Having started
                        the journey towards this career landmark courtesy of singles for his first album project.
                        Accompanied by a nationwide tour covering the entire country, WIDE-EYED represents a serious
                        step into the spotlight from the rising star. The 15-track offering is a testament to the
                        four-year
                        journey that has taken Said The Sky to the level of artistry he shows us today. Reflecting on
                        the
                        journey to his debut LP, Said the Sky explains: ‘This LP turned out as the story of falling in
                        and
                        out of love. The first half of the album kind of portrays the feelings you have when you first
                        meet somebody and are falling madly in love, while the second half represents the feelings you
                        can go through after everything falls apart. This wasn’t a conscious decision from the
                        beginning.
                        I decided to create the whole album when I realized I was sitting on quite a few tunes
                        that could live in the same world and could be part of the same story.’ <br>

                        <span>Potions is a single that was released on May 30, 2019. One of the first times the song was
                            played for listeners was at the 10th Year Anniversary of Crush Arizona where Slander brought
                            out Colorado DJ Trevor Christensen, known as Said the Sky, to officially announce the
                            collab.
                            Shortly before its release, Slander sent out a tweet that said, “There is a very specific
                            reason
                            why we have waited to release #Potions.” The next day a music video was released. The track
                            features breathtaking vocals by indie singer JT Roach, who unravels a story of love, loss, a
                            nd the theme that human determination knows no bounds when you want something badly enough.
                            Behind the lyrics, beautiful acoustics accompany the heartbreaking words and are eventually
                            joined by some of the most heavenly and ethereal bass sounds to grace the ears of EDM
                            listeners. <br>
