                            this picture. The mountains alone were beautiful alone, but I saw a couple of ducks
                            walk across a puddle and thought the picture would look pretty as a reflection. The
                            water you see in this photo isn't even a foot deep it's an actual puddle.

                            to work hand in hand with the Jordanian Military and was shown around like a
                            local. This is on the outskirts of Petra, a city that is also known as
                            "Rose City". The culture in this area is very different from American culture
                            and was a great experience.

                            on an early fall morning. I really like how to fall colors really pop in this. I
                            really didn't have to do much editing to this photo. I went in and made the trees
                            more vibrant to stand out. One of my favorite things about landscape photography
                            in Colorado is that it is so colorful and changes so drastically between seasons.

                        <h2> This is taken in Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs. I was there hiking when I
                            saw these rock climbers in their element. While I do enjoy mostly landscape, I also
                            enjoy taking photos of people doing what they enjoy. As a rock climber myself, it was
                            fun to capture this. I think the lighting and the shadows help focus on the individuals
                            themselves.

                            was really great for him. The original photo had his body in it as well, but I cropped that
                            out to have a main focus on his icy blue eyes.

                            mountain
                            and hiked at 4am to get a good location and view.
